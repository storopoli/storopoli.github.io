The list above is just a quick summary of his achievements. Everywhere you look in mathematics, physics, computer science, and even biology and economics, you’ll find von Neumann’s fingerprints.\nThe Sharpest Mind of the 20th Century Von Neumann was recognized by his peers as one of the most intelligent people to have ever lived. Johnny, as he was known to his friends, was a prodigy since early childhood. Some sources suggest that he could multiply two 8-digit numbers together in his head when he was six. As a child, von Neumann absorbed Ancient Greek and Latin, and spoke French, German and English as well as his native Hungarian. He devoured a forty-five-volume history of the world and was able to recite whole chapters verbatim decades later.\nHere are some quotes from his contemporaries:\nEnrico Fermi (Nobel Prize winner) while talking to Herbert Anderson: “You know, Herb, Johnny can do calculations in his head ten times as fast as I can! And I can do them ten times as fast as you can, Herb, so you can see how impressive Johnny is!”\nGeorge Pólya (mathematician, and whose lectures von Neumann attended as a student): “Johnny was the only student I was ever afraid of. If in the course of a lecture I stated an unsolved problem, the chances were he’d come to me at the end of the lecture with the complete solution scribbled on a slip of paper.”\nEdward Teller (father of the hydrogen bomb): “Von Neumann would carry on a conversation with my 3-year-old son, and the two of them would talk as equals, and I sometimes wondered if he used the same principle when he talked to the rest of us.”\nHans Bethe (Nobel Prize winner): “I have sometimes wondered whether a brain like von Neumann’s does not indicate a species superior to that of man.”\nStanislaw Ulam (co-inventor of the Monte Carlo method): “I have had a brain, and von Neumann had a computer.”\nClaude Shannon (father of information theory): “the smartest person I’ve ever met.”\nMarina von Neumann Whitman (his daughter): “Although he genuinely adored my mother, my father’s first love in life was thinking, a pursuit that occupied most of his waking hours.”\nVon Neumann and Oppenheimer together in-front of one of the computing machines used on the hydrogen bomb project. Von Neumann could do calculations in his head faster than these early computers and would sometimes face off against them in competitions meant to entertain the other people in the labs. If you want to know more about von Neumann, I recommend his biography: The Man from the Future: The Visionary Life of John von Neumann by Ananyo Bhattacharya.\nThe Fly Puzzle One of the most famous stories about von Neumann is the fly puzzle. This was reported by Eugene Wigner in the 1966 documentary on Von Neumann. Below is the exact part where Wigner tells the story:\nThe tale takes place in Los Alamos during the Manhattan Project. Max Born (Nobel Prize winner) told von Neumann’s the following puzzle:\nTwo bicycles begin 20 miles apart, and each travels toward the other at 10 miles per hour until they collide; meanwhile, a fly travels continuously back and forth between the bicycles at 15 miles per hour until it is squashed in the collision. How far does the fly travel in total?\nOne can solve this rather easily by not paying attention to the inherent infinite geometric series that the fly travels. Instead, focus on the fact that the fly is squashed when the bicycles collide, and that the two bicycles will collide in one hour. Thus, the fly travels 15 miles in total.\nBy the time Born had finished the question, von Neumann had already solved it. He said “Why? 15 miles, of course.” Born was surprise and said that Johnny was “one of my first scientist friends that saw the solution immediately.” Johnny then replied “I can’t understand that. It is a simple infinite geometrical series.”\nNow, to understand how fast von Neumann’s mind was, let’s solve the problem the way he did. Note that the fly reaches the second bicycle when\n$$ 15t = 20 - 10t,$$\nwhere $t$ is the time in hours. Note that $t_1$ is\n$$ t_1 = \\frac{20}{25} = \\frac{4}{5}.$$\nThis means that the total time it takes for the fly to reach the second bicycle for the first time is $\\frac{4}{5}$ hours and the total distance traveled by the fly is $d_1 = 15 \\times \\frac{4}{5} = 12$ miles. It then turns around and reaches the first bicycle when\n$$ 12 - 15t = 8 + 10t.$$\nSolving for $t_2$ we get\n$$ t_2 = \\frac{4}{25}.$$\nContinuing, the total distance traveled by the fly is given by summing the series\n$$ 15 \\sum_{n=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{4}{5^n} = 15.$$\nThis is a classical geometric series. In general, a geometric series is written as $a + ar + ar^{2} + ar^{3} + \\ldots$, where a $a$ is the coefficient of each term and $r$ is the common ratio between adjacent terms.\nHere we have $a = 12$ and $r = \\frac{4}{5}$, and we know it converges to $\\frac{a}{1-r} = 15$ when $r \u003c 1$.\nThat’s how von Neumann solved the problem in his head in a matter of seconds.\nLicense This post is licensed under Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International.\n","wordCount":"1150","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2024-06-22T05:54:46-03:00","dateModified":"2024-06-22T08:29:18-03:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Jose Storopoli"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://storopoli.io/2024-06-22-von-neumann/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Jose Storopoli, PhD","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://storopoli.io/assets/favicon.svg"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script crossorigin=anonymous src=/assets/js/theme.b20f95bb4da41ef90a2610a557a7000b2649a3f47282ec571676da6fc0427200.js integrity="sha256-sg+Vu02kHvkKJhClV6cACyZJo/RyguxXFnbab8BCcgA="></script><header class=header><div id=progressBar></div><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://storopoli.io/ accesskey=h title="Jose Storopoli, PhD (Alt + H)">Jose Storopoli, PhD</a><div class=logo-switches><button type=button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button><ul class=lang-switch><li>|</li></ul></div></div><input name=hamburger-input id=hamburger-input type=checkbox aria-label="Navigation Menu">
