I am a software developer with a PhD and background in
Computational Statistics.
I primarily work with cryptography,
zero-knowledge protocols,
censorship-resistant tools,
and distributed systems.

In hope of a better future,
I dedicate most of my waking hours
to [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org)-related projects,
because ["cypherpunks write code"](https://www.activism.net/cypherpunk/manifesto.html)
and "fix the money, fix the world".

If you are in a bad day, grab a curated Stoicism piece of advice at
[`stoicquotes.io`](https://stoicquotes.io).

Also, remember that you might be wrong,
or, don't use $P=0$ for your [priors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromwell%27s_rule).
Finally,
[never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor).

Everything that I do is either open source
or has a permissive Creative Commons license.
"Open source everything".

I don't have social media, since I think they are overrated
and "they sell your data".
