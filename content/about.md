I am a software developer with a background in computational statististics,
scienfitic computing, data science, machine learning/deep learning,
backend development, and full-stack web development.
In other words, I make computers go faster while crunching big numbers
(which is almost everything that they do).
I am also an ardent [Bayesian](https://youtu.be/RMNwsdb5VU4).
I like [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/),
[Julia](https://julialang.org),
[Nix](https://nixos.org),
[Vim](https://www.vim.org),
and [htmx](https://htmx.org).
I love math, computer science, coding, stats, and teaching.
I practice [Stoic Philosophy](https://stoicquotes.io) daily.
I hate [bloatware and the soydev phenomenon](https://storopoli.io/2023-11-10-2023-11-13-soydev/).
Everything that I do is either open source or has a permissive Creative Commons license.

I don't have social media, since I think they are overrated
and "they sell your data".
